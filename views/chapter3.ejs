            <pre>

            If you have observed the above algorithm, algorithm starts at step 1
            and continues a head.

            At step 2 the variable Max is initialized to A[1], that means we
             have assumed that very first element of an array is greatest one.

            Then check whether next element of an array is greatest or not.

            Thus observe all the elements of an array if any larger element is
             obtained it will be stored in Max.

            Thus the variable Max will be over written by larger element of an array.

            Finally in Max largest element will get stored.

                        The Exitloop causes immediate, abrupt exit from loop

                    The	sub-algorithms	can	be given	by functions or	procedures. Hence while writing function for the algorithm simply write –
                    
                    Function name_of_the_function which should be followed by steps of that function,
                    <strong>For example </strong>
                    Function SQUARE (NUM)
                    In this function we calculate square of variable NUM. And result will be stored in the variable RESULT.
                    1.	[Compute the square of NUM]
                    RESULT ← NUM * NM
                    2.	[Return the value of RESULT] Return (RESULT)
                    	In the	same way	procedure	is written.	The	only thing is	we use
                    keyword procedure name_of_procedure

                This is similar to construction of a house

                  <li>If you have suggestions, the architects notes it down and makes the necessary changes in the plan until you are happy.</li>
                  <li>Finally the blue print of the house gets ready and actual construction activity starts. This becomes easy and systematic for construction of the desired house</li>

                <h3 class="w3-text-orange">We present a technique for the development of program called the program development cycle which involves several steps as follows:</h3>
                
                <ul>
                  <li>Feasibility study</li>

                </ul>

                <h4>Lets discuss each step one by one</h4>

                <li><strong class="w3-text-orange">Feasibility study:</strong>The problem is analyzed to decide whether it is feasible to develop some program for the given problem statement. If we found that it is feasible then the further steps will be carried out</li>
                <li><strong class="w3-text-orange">Requirement analysis and problem specification</strong>
                  <li>The programmer has to find out the essential requirement for
                    solving the given problem by communicating with the users of the software. Programmer then has to decide what are the inputs needed for the program, in which form the inputs are to be given, the order of the inputs, what kind of output should be generated. Thus the total requirement for the program has to be analyzed.</li>
                </li>
                <li><strong class="w3-text-orange">Design:</strong>•	Once	the	requirement	analysis	is	done,	the	design	can	be
                  prepared using the problem specification document. In this step, the algorithm has to be designed for some most suitable data structure.</li>
                <li><strong class="w3-text-orange">Coding:</strong>•	When the design of the program is ready then coding becomes
                  a simple job. Because the programming language is selected in the design, coding begins by simply breaking the problem into small modules.</li>
                <li><strong class="w3-text-orange">Debugging:</strong>in this phase we compile the code and check whether any errors are there. If any error is there then we try to eliminate the
                  errors. The debugging needs complete scan of the program.</li>
                <li><strong class="w3-text-orange">Testing:</strong>Here, certain set of input data is given to the program and the program should show the desired results as output.</li>
                <li><strong class="w3-text-orange">Maintenance:</strong>Once the	code is ready, it is tested properly and in case the
                  users requires some modifications in the code then those modifications should easily be carried out. Modularity in the code has to be maintained.</li>
                  <li>
                  <li>The	documentation	is		not		a		separate	step	in	program development	process		but	it		is	required	at	every	step.
                    Documentation means providing help or some manual which
                    will help the user to make use of the code in proper direction.</li>
                  <li>It is a good practice to maintain some kind of document for every phase of compilation process.</li>>

              </p>
              <h4>Various algorithmic strategies are-</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong class="w3-text-orange">Divide and conquer</strong>– In this strategy the problem is divided into smaller sub-problems and these sub-problems are solved to obtain the solution to main problem.</li>
                <li><strong class="w3-text-orange">Greedy technique</strong>- From a set of obtained solutions the best possible solution is chosen each time, to obtain the final solution.</li>
                <li><strong class="w3-text-orange">Back tracking</strong>- In this method, in order to obtain the solution trial and error method is followed.</li>
                <li><strong class="w3-text-orange">Dynamic Programming</strong>- The problem is divided into smaller instances and results of smaller reoccurring instances are obtained to solve the problem.</li>
